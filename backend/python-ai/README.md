## What I Built
I implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI Embeddings and ChromaDB vector search.

## Why I Chose This Approach
I selected RAG for three compelling reasons. 
- First, I leveraged my deep familiarity with embedding-based retrieval systems to create a solution that delivers immediate value. 
- Second, by building on existing libraries like ChromaDB and OpenAI, I ensured robust performance while maintaining development velocity. 
- Most importantly, this approach forms the critical foundation of the entire mental health platformâ€”the stronger our knowledge retrieval core, the more personalized and effective our support becomes, directly translating to improved user outcomes and higher engagement.

## Future Extensions
This foundation opens exciting pathways for evolution:
1) Implementing a sophisticated knowledge graph to map intricate relationships between mental health concepts, enabling more nuanced understanding of user concerns
2) Developing an adaptive memory system that tracks user progress over time, personalizing responses based on individual journeys and creating truly continuous care
3) Expanding into multi-modal analysis by processing images, audio, and video to detect subtle emotional cues that text alone might miss
4) Creating a powerful feedback loop where mental health professionals review and enhance the system's responses, establishing a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement that bridges AI capabilities with human expertise
